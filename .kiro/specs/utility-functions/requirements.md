# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive utils.py module that contains commonly used utility functions for Python development. The module should provide reusable functions that can be imported and used across different Python projects, following best practices and coding standards referenced in the Claude prompt library.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want a centralized utils.py module with common utility functions, so that I can avoid code duplication and improve development efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the utils.py module is imported THEN it SHALL provide access to all utility functions without errors
2. WHEN any utility function is called with valid parameters THEN it SHALL return the expected result
3. WHEN any utility function is called with invalid parameters THEN it SHALL raise appropriate exceptions with clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file and directory manipulation utilities, so that I can easily handle common file operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to read a file THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to safely read file contents
2. WHEN I need to write to a file THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to safely write content with proper error handling
3. WHEN I need to check if a path exists THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to validate file/directory existence
4. WHEN I need to create directories THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to create directories recursively

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data processing utilities, so that I can efficiently manipulate and transform data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to flatten nested lists THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to flatten lists of any depth
2. WHEN I need to remove duplicates from lists THEN the utility SHALL provide a function that preserves order
3. WHEN I need to chunk data THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to split lists into smaller chunks
4. WHEN I need to merge dictionaries THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to deep merge nested dictionaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want string manipulation utilities, so that I can perform common text processing tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to clean text THEN the utility SHALL provide functions to remove extra whitespace and normalize strings
2. WHEN I need to validate formats THEN the utility SHALL provide functions to validate emails, URLs, and other common patterns
3. WHEN I need to convert case THEN the utility SHALL provide functions for snake_case, camelCase, and kebab-case conversions
4. WHEN I need to truncate text THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to safely truncate strings with ellipsis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want logging and debugging utilities, so that I can easily add consistent logging to my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to set up logging THEN the utility SHALL provide a function to configure logging with different levels
2. WHEN I need to time function execution THEN the utility SHALL provide a decorator to measure execution time
3. WHEN I need to debug function calls THEN the utility SHALL provide a decorator to log function inputs and outputs
4. WHEN I need to handle exceptions gracefully THEN the utility SHALL provide utilities for exception handling and reporting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration and environment utilities, so that I can manage application settings consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to load configuration THEN the utility SHALL provide functions to load from JSON, YAML, and environment variables
2. WHEN I need to validate configuration THEN the utility SHALL provide functions to validate required settings
3. WHEN I need environment detection THEN the utility SHALL provide functions to detect development, staging, and production environments
4. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the utility SHALL provide clear error messages with suggestions
